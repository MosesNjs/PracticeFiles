// take notes here after consuming the content 
// practice code here as well

// assume two variables equal two different numbers, write code to switch the value of the variables 

var a = 4;
var b = 7; 

// make a = 7 and b = 4

var c = a;
a = b; 
b = c;

console.log("a is " + a);
console.log("b is " + b);
